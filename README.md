# Differentially Private Sliced Wasserstein Distance

This repository contains the code of our paper  "Differentially Private Sliced Wasserstein Distance" to appear at ICML 2021.

## Installation

* Pytorch 1.8
* autodp

## Short Summary

DP-SWD computation is in file distrib_distance.py
ClassDANN and ClassSWD contains the DP-DANN and the DP-SWD train/inference algorithm
da_settings.py and da_models are utility files that contain model and learning parameters.

the file da_dp_analysis.py presents how we have computed the noise standard deviation given a desired accuracy. For this, we use the autodp package https://github.com/yuxiangw/autodp

# Results reproduction

for reproducing the Domain adaptation results, one has to run the da_digits.py file. Selecting the settings allows to train either MNIST-USPS or USPS-MNIST.
